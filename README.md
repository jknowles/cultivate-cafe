The Cultivate Cafe homepage is hosted on GitHub Pages and powered by Jekyll, a
static blog/website engine that works smoothly with GitHub.

# Contributing

An advantage of using Jekyll is that users can edit plain-text Markdown
files instead of HTML code. To add content to the website, users can edit
files with *.md* extensions, which are Markdown files that contain the
content of the website.

Each *.md* file has a header which should not be edited, this header controls
the layout and structure of template pages and the final website.
