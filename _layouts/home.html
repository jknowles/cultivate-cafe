  OpenSDP is an online, public repository of analytic code, tools, and training
  intended to foster collaboration among education analysts and researchers in
  order to accelerate the improvement of our school systems. This community was
  built by the <a href="https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu">Strategic Data Project</a>, an initiative of
  the <a href="https://cepr.harvard.edu">Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard</a>.

  <h2>Tools</h2>

  On OpenSDP you will have access to data, analyses and tutorials for every stage of
  the analytic cycle, from preparing and standardizing your data, to conducting
  analyses and producing visualizations.
