## What is Cultivate?

Cultivate is a fast-casual restaurant located in the near
north campus district just a few blocks from YSU and steps south of historic
Wick Park. The coolest thing about Cultivate is right there in its
name -- Cultivate: a co-op cafe! Cultivate is owned and managed
cooperatively -- that means the farmers and food makers who supply the products
are the actual owners of the Cafe and share jointly in its management, risks and
rewards. Employees have ownership share in it as well. So we're cultivating
growth for our members-the farmers and food makers (cheese, hot sauce, etc.),
we're cultivating a revitalization of our neighborhood, and we're cultivating
(we hope!) the desire and opportunity for students, local people, downtown folks
to support and choose healthier, locally sourced food.

## How did the idea for creating this space come about?

The idea of buying food
on the north side of Youngstown has been around since the inception of the
Northside Farmer's Market in 2003. That inspired the whole "food hub"
idea--opening the shared-use commercial kitchen at the Common Wealth Kitchen
Incubator, gathering the farmers together to talk about and then start their
efforts to market their products together. Cultivate was kind of the next
step--we've been trying to get local restaurants on board with local sourcing
from these farmers with no real success so the farmer group said--"let's open
our own place!"

## Tell us about the menu!  

We're walking the walk when it comes to local, sustainable,
authentic food! Farmers are delivering their product right from the field to
the Cafe and working with Sue, the Cafe Manager, to grow things specifially
for the Cafe. Other products are made right next door in the Common Wealth
Kitchen and brought over freshly prepared which, by the way, increases sales
for those "makers" and helps them grow their business--keeping our food
dollars in our own community. Of course our menu is seasonal--we're just
finishing up with butternut squash soup from local farmers and apples in
salads as those stored well this past winter. But our taste buds seek lighter,
brighter fare as the season changes and we'll soon have strawberries and
asparagus from right here in Mahoning County to make scones, soups, and sides!
The menu varies with product availability but we're fortunate to be able to
preserve products to use for later in the season too so we'll be freezing
those berries and other produce as it comes along. However--some things are
such favorites they can't go away so you'll always find the comforts of tomato
soup and a grilled cheese on the menu and the scones--which are to die
for--may change flavor combos but are menu staples.

### You’ve partnered with local farmers in the Youngstown area, which is so awesome!  Tell us about those relationships and what it’s like to keep it all local.

Farmers are the
owners of the Cafe--it's member-owned and managed. So farmers and food makers
are integral to the operation. They work with Cafe management so that the
veggies, fruits, meat, cheese and eggs they work so hard to grow and produce
are the stars of the menu! And that's how food really should be--fresh, simply
prepared, and seasonal so we can all taste and savor the deliciousness in ever
bite. Cultivate not only has a cafe, but a market!  

## Share a little about that and what people can find there!

Those farmers just keep pushing! They had an
"e-commerce" site as a way to purchase products and wanted to grow their
presence in the community. Opening a "bricks and mortar" location, using the
knowledge gained from the online market over the past few years, seemed like
the next natural step. We have such abundance here in teh Valley--people
sometimes forget about that, but we're rich in so many ways. There are lots of
local and regional products for sale at the Market--meat, eggs, cheese, milk,
ice cream available year round from local farms. Apples stored all winter,
just coming to the end of potatoes, squash, garlic and other root veggies but
our farmers are already bringing in greens and microgreens--radishes and other
crunchy things won't be far behind. And we're excited to have products from
regional makers--Wake Robin fermented foods like kimchee and carrots, locally
brewed kombucha from Bearded Buch in Cleveland, a great vegan spread that's so
creamy you'll never miss the dairy from Red Lotus Foods--exciting stuff!

### Many people may not know about the Commonwealth Kitchen Incubator. What are they, and how is Cultivate connected?

The mother ship of local food! The Common
Wealth Kitchen Incubator is what makes it all possible--for us and for lots of
other local producers! At the Kitchen, people can make a food or personal care
product (pet food too!) and, because the Kitchen is a licensed facility,
makers can sell their product at grocery stores, farmer's markets, ship
products across state lines or be a licensed caterer, something that many
locations require to sell food on premises. Food trucks can use the Kitchen as
their commissary, making food there and selling right from the truck. So many
products are made there--sauces, popcorn, granola and trail mix, kale chips,
frozen pops--it's really inspiring to be around all the creative folks and
we're all drawing inspiration and generating excitement just from being in the
same space. We really hope more people will be inspired to bring what they
make to market--with the Cafe and Co-op Market right next door, there are
built in sales opportunities.
